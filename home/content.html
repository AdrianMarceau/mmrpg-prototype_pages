        Several years after the Wily Wars finally subside, <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Light</strong> and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Cossack</strong> join forces and embark on a quest to build the most advanced robot database and battle simulator the world will ever know. Together, they create a vast and complex virtual reality where AI versions of robot masters and human beings can interact with each other in new and exciting ways, all while their physical operators remain safely outside in the real world. Their experimental project, tentatively titled &quot;<strong>The&nbsp;Prototype</strong>&quot;, is set to be unveiled to the public tomorrow. Both doctors are nervously excited to show off their years of hard work to their colleagues, but something mysterious lurks in the shadows&hellip;

        <strong class="site_name">Mega&nbsp;Man&nbsp;RPG&nbsp;Prototype</strong> is a browser-based fangame where you square off against hordes of increasingly challenging robots in turn-based battles, paying tribute to (and embracing our nostalgia of) retro role-playing games. Prototype merges the addictive collection and battle mechanics of the <em>Pok√©mon</em> series with the beloved robot masters and special weapons of the classic <em>Mega&nbsp;Man</em> series to create something quaint yet new. While our game unfolds in the original timeline, <em>Battle Network</em> series fans may recognize a familiar face or two.  With three distinct campaigns, more than a hundred playable characters, and an ever-expanding array of unique abilities, there's a wealth of discovery awaiting in <strong>The&nbsp;Prototype</strong>.

        This project has been a massive labour-of-love over the years with our first playable version (our <em>literal</em> prototype) being rolled out in early 2011.  Since then, we've welcomed thousands of players from around the globe into our community, all sharing their love for Mega Man and their experiences within the game.  Some have even become valued contributors to our project, their steadfast efforts expanding our roster, building out our world, and making MMRPG even better with each passing day.
