    Use the <strong>Roleplay &amp; Games</strong> board for all your play-by-post role-playing-game needs! While it is not necessary for threads to be related to the prototype per-se, they should be related to Mega Man classic in some form.  Standard community etiquette applies, but please also take note of any thread-specific rules or requirements and be prepared to have your posts deleted by mods if you do not follow them.  Thank you for your co-operation and have fun! :D
