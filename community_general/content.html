    Use the <strong>General Discussion</strong> board for all topics that do not fit into the other categories.  As time goes on, more categories will be added to the community focusing on specific aspects of the game - but until then all topics <em>not</em> involving updates, bug reports, game mechanics or development will stay on this board.  Please stay on-topic, and use common sense when choosing your language and subject matter - this project is and always will be family friendly and adult and/or offensive comments will be removed without notice.  Thank you for your co-operation and please enjoy the community.  :)
