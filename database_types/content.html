    <div class="subbody">
        <p class="text">
            Robots, abilities, and even locations in the <strong>Mega Man RPG Prototype</strong> are represented by and categorized into <!-- MMRPG_DATABASE_TYPES_COUNT --> different elemental types.  These types play an important role in the game and have notable effects in and out of battle.  Some types are more common than others, but all have their uses.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            A robot's core type determines which abilities it can equip and its proficiency with those abilities in battle.  Ability types can trigger the weaknesses, resistances, and even immunities of target robots to influence damage and recovery amounts in battle. Even fields have their own elemental affinities!
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            While many robots and abilities fall under one type it is not uncommon for a character or weapon to have a secondary element. Diverse type combos and matchups are at the heart of the <strong>Prototype</strong> and experimentation is highly encouraged.
