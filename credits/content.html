    <p class="text">The <strong>Mega Man RPG Prototype</strong> was created and is continually developed and maintained by Adrian Marceau / Ageman20XX, though the project would not have been possible without a great deal of inspiration and contributions from multiple outside sources.  Being a Mega Man fan-game, this project obviously owes most of it's thanks to <a href="http://www.capcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a> and of course, Keiji Inafune.  Most of the assets used throughout this website and game were created by Capcom for use in the original games, so their role in this project is far from minor and greatly influential. In addition, their generally positive attitude about fan-games and other types of fan-tribute have been very admirable over the years, and both this game and the Mega Man community owe them much gratitude.</p>

    <!-- MMRPG_ROBOT_FLOAT_SPRITE('shadow-man', 'left', '05') -->
    <p class="text">Capcom are not the only ones to thank, however, as many others have contributed to this project over the years.  Though most of the actual design and development has been done by Adrian thus far, hours of play-testing, tons of feature ideas, mechanics discussions, and even additional sprite editing has been provided by talented and generous outside sources over the years.  New members are being added to the team all the time, and even the smallest amount of effort is appreciated.  If you would like to help with sprite editing, bug testing, feature ideas, or anything please <a href="contact/">contact me</a> and we'll discuss the details.  You'll be credited appropriately on this page, with a link back to your home page and a custom description if you want them.</p>

                Video game remixer TheLegendOfRenegade is responsible for all music and sound effects found in the Mega Man RPG and graciously agreed to let us use his work way back in July 2013.
                All tracks come from his massive, multi-game-spanning Sega Genesis / MD Remix library of music and they each bring unique and much-appreciated flavour to the atmosphere of the RPG's soundtrack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Renegade's robot master themes from Mega Man 1 - 10, Mega Man & Bass, and even Mega Man Powered Up are represented here as well as a few miscellaneous boss themes, menu themes, stage select themes, and even special stage themes from a range of classic titles.
                The overall level of quality and polish these remixes bring to our game is beyond words, and I am so, <em>so</em> grateful that we've been able to showcase them in the RPG for all these years.
            </p>
            <p>TheLegendOfRenegade has done some truly great work, and I think I speak for everyone on the team when I say &quot;thank you&quot;!  ^_^</p>

        The majority of the sprites that appear in this game were found on the number one Mega Man sprite resource - Sprites Inc. - and without the the website I'm sure many Mega Man fan-games would not have been possible.  Even the custom sprites are based on those found on this website, and I cannot thank the creators and contributors enough for their efforts and the fantastic service they provide.  I highly recommend the website for all your Mega Man sprite needs.  :)

        Miscellaneous other sprites that appear in this game have bits and pieces of sheets found on The Spriters Resource.  While Sprites Inc. is the #1 shop for Mega Man series sprites, The Spriters Resource has virtually everything other game series covered.  Another highly recommended site if what you're looking for can't be found at the above.  Thank you to all the contributors of that site who inadvertently helped with the development of this game. :)

        The Mega Man Knowledge Base is used as a constant reference for robot weaknesses, official names, artwork, quotes, and so much more.  This is one of the best resources on the internet for official Mega Man data and without it this game would not have been possible.  Thank you, Mega Man community, for this incredibly useful resource.  :D

        All MP3 tracks were converted to Firefox-compatible OGG files using this tool, and it has been incredibly helpful in easing the pain of cross-browser support.  Their online audio conversion is very simple to use and is completely free.  I am so happy that this tool exists and recommend it to anyone interested in HTML game development.

            <p>CHAOS_FANTAZY joined the community in January 2014 and was originally going to help write the general story and narrative for the game.  Unfortunately, as the goals of our project changed and the narrative became less of a focus, CHAOS_FANTAZY decided to step back and go his own way.  Either way, his contributions to our discussions were still appreciated and it was great having him around.</p>

            <p>ThatGuyNamedMikey joined us in September 2014 and has been a frequent sight on the leaderboards, in the community, and around the various chat rooms since.  Many know Mike as our most vocal advocate for game-balance and he is often the first to point out potential issues with features or ideas before they go too far.  Mike was also responsible for creating our first chat room (Xat) and played a key role in our upgrading to a better platform (Ajax) when the time came.  Mike has hosted countless tournaments, contests, and other events since joining the community and even served as a moderator for a time.  His contributions are appreciated by many.</p>

            <p>Shiver joined our community in September of 2016, attracting immediate prominence for toppling our leaderboards and providing a unique competitive viewpoint. Coupled with a no-nonsense attitude and an amiable presence, it was only a matter of time before Shiver was bestowed the responsibility of chat and community moderator, always keeping conversations within the proper channels and boundaries. Sadly, as does often happen in life, Shiver went on their separate way, eventually choosing to resign from the role of moderator. Regardless, their services and assistance as a moderator and player will certainly not be forgotten, and we wish them the best in their future efforts!</p>

            <p>TheDoc joined the community back in June 2013, being one of the early pioneers of MMRPG bug-testing and feedback assessments. Users who frequented the chat then would fondly remember TheDoc for his amusing demeanor, though when it came to game discussion, he could masterfully turn on a dime and cut precisely to the heart of an issue. It is of no surprise to anyone that TheDoc inevitably became a moderator, and in doing so still remained steadfast to always consider his peers and community first and foremost. It’s his involvement that continues to help shape our community today. Thank you Doc!</p>
