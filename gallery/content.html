  <p class="text">The <strong>Mega Man RPG Prototype</strong> has gone through many, many changes over the last few years and - luckily - I'm pretty good at taking screenshots! Each of these images is a window into the game's development and progress at that point in time, and together they provide a clearer picture of how far the prototype since it's early days of a single-button main menu and one hours-long eight-vs-eight battle. :P  Hover over any of the thumbnails below to see a brief description of its contents and date, or click it to view the screenshot at full resolution.  Please enjoy the images, and <a href="contact/">let me know</a> if you have any questions.</p>
