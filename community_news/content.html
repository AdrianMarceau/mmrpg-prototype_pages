    The <strong>News &amp; Updates</strong> board contains an archive of all website and prototype-related updates that have been posted to the community. These include feature additions, mechanics tweaks, new pages, and more. The News &amp; Updates board exists primarily as a means to chronicle the game's development and to allow timely feedback from players on the changes made to the game. Naturally, discussions in this category can only be created by website admins and contributors and are not open to user submission.
